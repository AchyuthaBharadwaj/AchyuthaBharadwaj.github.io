In this project I implemented neural networks with convolutional, pooling and the dropout layers.

## Neural network with one convolutional layer, one pooling layer and dropout

[link to repository](https://github.com/AchyuthaBharadwaj/Machine-Learning/tree/master/CNN)

Used 10 filters in the convolutional layer, each of them should be of size 3 × 3 patches with stride 1 for convolution layer. Added a max pooling layer after the convolutional layer with 2 × 2 pooling and stride 1. This layer is fully connected to the second hidden layer. introduced 50% dropout for updating the weights.<br/>
